        "value": "<p><em>This nimble, raccoon-like humanoid has grey-brown fur, a ringed tail, and sharp claws that allow it to scamper up trees with aplomb. Dark markings like a rogue’s domino mask surround a pair of glowing yellow eyes that hint at its otherworldly origins.</em><br><strong>Trickster Spirits.</strong> Azebans are mischievous fey spirits who enjoy playing tricks and causing trouble for others, particularly dull-witted humans. These pranks are most often trivial—rather than dangerous or malevolent—and frequently involve the azeban tricking its victims out of food or a magical trinket or causing an argument to break out among a group of travelers. Azebans like targeting pompous, greedy, or prideful individuals best. Skillful illusionists, they sometimes use powerful magic to create an illusory inn or village to fool their marks. On other occasions, a simple cantrip to make it appear as if someone belched or broke wind in polite company is all that is needed.<br><strong>Forest Dwellers.</strong> Living primarily in the pine forests of the cold northern lands, azebans get on well with the druids and shamans of barbarian tribes, who often seek out their advice on fey matters in exchange for food and magical baubles. Azebans prefer to make their homes close to water. Good climbers, they sleep among the branches of the pines at night, coming down to the water to eat. They are fussy eaters and always wash their food before consuming it.<br><strong>Reckless Souls.</strong> Azebans are quite fearless and have a tendency to get in over their heads. The shamans of the north tell a story that the first azeban wandered through the forest until he came to a great waterfall. Being somewhat foolish, he decided to get into a shouting match with the roaring torrent. Yelling louder and louder in an attempt to defeat his foe, he stepped too close to the edge and plunged headfirst into the rushing waters. Fortunately, the azeban did not drown, and to this day his descendants are able to emit an ear-splitting yawp as a last-ditch defense against aggressors.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",
