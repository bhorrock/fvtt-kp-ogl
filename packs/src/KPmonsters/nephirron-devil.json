It opens its mouth in a sardonic smile, and the head of a serpent appears between its lips, hissing with malevolent, mirthful relish.</em><br><strong>Devilish Infiltrators.</strong> Nephirron devils are powerful fiends with draconic features that are adept at corrupting good-aligned dragons and bending evil dragons to their will. The older and more powerful the dragon, the bigger the challenge in the eyes of the nephirron devil. When two of these devils meet, they typically boast about the number and types of dragons they have manipulated and destroyed. This pride can also be a nephirron devil’s undoing, however, for it often overlooks humanoids attempting to interfere with its plans, and more than one nephirron devil has been brought low by a band of mortal heroes.<br><strong>Hellish Nobles.</strong> Nephirron devils are treated as lesser nobility in the hells, second only to pit fiends and arch-devils in the infernal pecking order. A nephirron devil is often served by @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPghostdragon]{ghost dragons}, remnants of good and evil dragons the nephirron devil corrupted and inevitably consumed.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",

As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.<br>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.<br>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</table><br><em><strong>On Target.</strong></em> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</table><br><em><strong>Off Target.</strong></em> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</table><br><em><strong>Similar Area.</strong></em> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</table><br><em><strong>Mishap.</strong></em> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.<br>During this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.",
