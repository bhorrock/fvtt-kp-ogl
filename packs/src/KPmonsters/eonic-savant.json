In spite of this mastery, they are no closer to finding the cure or the correct time stream for their dying ancient civilization.<br><strong>Calm and Assured.</strong> Unlike their kin, eonic savants hold the energy to jump through time within their bodies, freeing them from a reliance on their people’s crystal belts and the paranoia its loss brings. Savants devote themselves to studying the rivers of time and helping their kin, who are barely surviving time’s flood. They are certain with enough study and enough of their kin by their sides, they can discover the way to a cure and the way home.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",

The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.<br>The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has 3 Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space.<br>When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects<br>with it.<br><em><strong>Clenched fist.</strong></em> The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.<br><em><strong>Forceful Hand.</strong></em> The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the band's Strength contested by<br>the Strength (Athletics) check ofthe target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.<br><em><strong>Grasping Hand.</strong></em> The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the band's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.<br><em><strong>Interposing Hand.</strong></em> The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the band's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the band's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the band's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the band's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.",
