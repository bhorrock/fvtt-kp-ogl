        "value": "<p><em>A skeletal cadaver bedecked in the motley attire of a fool capers about while making jokes that mock mortality.</em><br><strong>Amusing Death.</strong> When a jester on his deathbed moves an evil death god to laughter, the fool sometimes gains a reprieve. becoming a grim jester, whose pranks serve to entertain the god of death. Their purpose is to bring an end to mortal lives in a gruesome, comic, and absurd manner. As long as such jesters keep the death god amused, their continued unlife is assured.<br><strong>Grisly Humor.</strong> A grim jester’s jokes are not funny to their victims, but they offer a grim finality in combat. A killing joke might be absurd, such as “Here is your final pineapple soul, a parting gift, goodbye.” or sheer braggadocio such as “Your footwork is atrocious, and your spell’s lost its focus, your party’s no match for my hocus-pocus.” Others might be high-flown, such as “Mortal, your time has come, the bell within your skull does ring, ding, dong, dead.” Grim jesters are famous for grim, bitter mockery such as “Your blood on fire, your heart pumps its last, show me now a hero’s last gasp!” or “Odin’s raven has come for you; the Valkyries were busy. You lose, mortal.”<br>A grim jester’s mockery rarely entertain the living—but gods of death, chained angels, and demons find them quite amusing.<br><strong>Randomness.</strong> Grim jesters often get their hands on wands of wonder and scrolls of chaos magic. Beware the grim jester with a deck of many things—they are quite talented in pulling cards whose magic then applies to foes and spectators.<br><strong>Undead Nature.</strong> A grim jester doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",

          "value": "<p>This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.<br>The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.<br>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.<br>A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.",
