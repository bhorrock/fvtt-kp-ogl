        "value": "<p><em>A slender creature with silvery skin moves delicately, as though unsure if the world around it is real. Star-like motes of white light dance in its black eyes.</em><br>A race of fey said to be born from the dreams of an ancient primeval being, yumerai walk in two worlds. Humanoid in appearance, they possess skin tones that range from pale silver to dark gray. Intrinsically tied to the dream world, they can use sleeping creatures as both weapons and transportation.<br><strong>Alien Minds.</strong> Although yumerai spend most of their time in the waking world, they have difficulty remembering the differences between dreams and reality. This leads some to misunderstand basic laws of physics or to believe dreams events were real events.<br><strong>Dream Walkers.</strong> A yumerai can enter an individual’s dreams and use those dreams as a means of transportation to another’s dreams. This process brief connects the creatures, though the yumerai tries not to make its presence known. When multiple people have the same dream, they may have had a yumerai pass through their sleeping minds.<br><strong>The Gift of Sleep.</strong> For a yumerai, sleep serves as both a tool and a gift. As creatures unable to sleep or dream, the yumerai consider the ability to dream a gift that all mortals should appreciate. As they travel through mortal dreams, yumerai collect energy from the dreams and use it as a form of currency in fey realms. Fey use dream energy in much the same way mortals use paint, creating seemingly alive portraits or making illusions look, smell, sound, or taste more real.<br><strong>The Horror of Nightmares.</strong> Yumerai usually look forward to the opportunity to experience new dreams. However, not all dreams are pleasant. Particularly horrifying nightmares may leave permanent mental scars on yumerai who witness them, changing them forever. These yumerai take on a sinister and sometimes sadistic personality, seeking to inflict the pain they felt through the nightmare on those around them.<br><strong>Dream Walker.</strong> A yumerai doesn’t require sleep.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",

If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.<br>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.<br>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see.

As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.<br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.",
