        "value": "<p><em>A rivulet of lava streams from a cavity between the shoulders of this four-armed, volcanic creature.</em><br><strong>Volcanic Guardians.</strong> Lava keepers are elementals from the borderlands between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire. They sometimes emerge onto the Material Plane through spontaneous elemental vortices in the hearts of volcanoes. Once on the Material Plane, they find themselves trapped. Instead of running rampant, they act as guardians for the region from which they emerged in the hopes that one day they can return home.<br><strong>Noble Elementals.</strong> Lava keepers are the natural enemies of salamanders and other chaotic elementals. They feel a mixture of shame and pity toward their corrupted brethren, the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPcherufe]{cherufes}, and go out of their way to put an end to any cherufes they encounter.<br><strong>Gods of the Mount.</strong> Lava keepers are sometimes worshiped by primitive humanoids living in volcanic regions. These humanoids offer the lava keeper tribute, and, in return, the lava keeper drives off harmful monsters and directs lava flows in ways that promote new life and maintain healthy soil. The two sides rarely possess the means to communicate with one another, and the lava keeper often has little understanding of the tribe’s true goals or motivations. While not evil, the lava keeper does not have the same concept of life as most humanoids and seldom intervenes in the sacrifice of a living creature. However, stories abound of sacrifices being saved by their lava keepers after the two discovered they could speak with each other.<br><strong>Elemental Nature.</strong> The lava keeper doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",

Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.<br>When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.ZkXz0qdkNBkKE6tN]{prone}.<br>This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.<br><em><strong>Fissures.</strong></em> Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.<br>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).<br><em><strong>Structures.</strong></em> The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A  creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.",
