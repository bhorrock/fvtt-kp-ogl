The common phrase, “never trust a gift horse,” stems from these corrupting devils.<br><strong>Horse-Headed but Wise.</strong> When called to the mortal world, they sometimes take the shape of a destrier. Orobas devils prefer to take the horrific form of a horse-headed man. Sulfuric smoke curls from their nostrils and their fingers sport ragged claws. This beast‑like appearance belies their true strength; the orobas possess an uncanny knowledge of the past, as well as of things to come.<br><strong>Masters of Deceit.</strong> When bargaining with an orobas, one must speak truthfully—or possess an exceptionally quick tongue and the most charming smile. Practitioners of the dark arts know these devils as the Lords of Distortion, for their ability to practice deceit. They prize reality-warping magic above all else, and bribes of that sort can win concessions when making a pact.<br><strong>Surrounded by Lessers.</strong> Orobas devils gather lesser devils both as chattel and defense. Their analytical minds telepathically confer the strengths and weaknesses of foes to their allies. With surprising speed, the deceivers can assess a battlefield, weigh outcomes, and redirect forces. Enemies of the orobas almost never catch them off guard. They have frequent, clear visions of their immediate future.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.<br>The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</table><br><em><strong>On Target.</strong></em> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</table><br><em><strong>Off Target.</strong></em> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</table><br><em><strong>Similar Area.</strong></em> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</table><br><em><strong>Mishap.</strong></em> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

          "value": "<p>A 10-foot-radius @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.hMWCeXenROGuhF1K]{invisible} sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.<br>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.<br><em><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong></em> Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.<br><em><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong></em> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as ﬁreball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the ﬂames created by a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.X3DrXgxjwI2dvkD6]{wall of fire}</em> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.<br><em><strong>Magic Items.</strong></em> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.<br>A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.<br><em><strong>Magical Travel.</strong></em> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.<br><em><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong></em> A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.<br><em><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong></em> Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.",
