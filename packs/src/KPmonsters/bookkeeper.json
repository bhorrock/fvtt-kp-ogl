They provide protection not just from unwanted intrusion but also from physical damage. The bookkeeper can move on its own when needed, but it spends most of its time hiding within the book it is assigned to guard.<br><strong>Alarm.</strong> As long as the creator is on the same plane as the book, it is mentally alerted if the book is opened by anyone other than it. The book also shrieks if handled by anyone other than the creator. The creator does not set off any wards or alarms when opening its own book.<br><strong>Construct Nature.</strong> A bookkeeper doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><h2>Alternate Traits and Actions</h2><br>The following changes allow GMs to alter a bookkeeper without modifying its challenge rating.<br><em><strong>Creator’s Mark.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> The bookkeeper marks the target with an invisible rune, which it and its creator can see. The mark can be removed with a dispel magic or similar magic.<br>The bookkeeper loses its bite attack.<br><em><strong>Dual Binding.</strong></em> The bookkeeper is attuned to two books rather than a single tome. It can use its Between the Lines trait to jump between books provided they are within range of each other. Its hp maximum reduction from its Book Bound trait only applies if it is farther than 60 feet from both books. Both books the bookkeeper are bound to are destroyed when it dies.<br>Stretching the bookkeeper’s magic across two books gives it the Antimagic Susceptibility trait:<ul><li>Antimagic Susceptibility. The bookkeeper is incapacitated while in an area of an <em>antimagic field</em>. If targeted by <em>dispel magic</em>, the bookkeeper must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.</li><br><em><strong>Nauseating Ink.</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, range 20 ft., one target <em>Hit:</em> 3 (1d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution save or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.<br>The bookkeeper loses its Ink Splash action.<br><em><strong>Possess Reader (Recharges after a Long Rest).</strong></em> The fiendish bookkeeper treats its book as a container for a magic jar spell. It can possess a humanoid per the magic jar spell (save DC 9) if the humanoid moves within 60 feet of it. The bookkeeper can only possess a target for 10 minutes before it must return to its book. A DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notices ink flowing through the whites of the possessed creature’s eyes, and a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check discovers the possession.<br>The fiendish bookkeeper loses its X Marks the Spot trait.<br><em><strong>Spell Attunement (Recharge 4–6).</strong></em> The bookkeeper has access to a 1st-level spell within its book. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 9, +1 to hit with spell attacks). It can use an action to innately cast the spell, requiring no material components.<br>The bookkeeper loses its Elusive Pages action.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",
