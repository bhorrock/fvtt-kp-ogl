No matter how a huli jing tries to hide its true nature, it can’t hide its fox scent from dogs.<br><strong>Energy Feeders.</strong> The huli jing possess great powers as long as they absorb sufficient energy, most often derived from moonlight or sunshine. This is but a trickle, however, compared to the life-force of mortals. Huli jing use their shapechanging to live among humans, secretly feeding off the populace or from willing allies, exchanging life energy for the fey’s aid.<br><strong>Symbols of Luck or Curses.</strong> The huli jing are neither good nor evil but act according to their individual natures. Some walk among the mortal races, their aid and kindness spreading tales of the huli jing’s auspicious benevolence. Others seek to confuse, trick, or harm mortals, and their malicious cruelty gives rise to stories of the huli jing as malevolent omens.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",

Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.<br>A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.<br>A <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> or <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}</em> spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).",
