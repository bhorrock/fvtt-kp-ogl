        "value": "<p><em>A barefoot woman with long hair and almost transparent skin sits upon a willow branch. Her hair and clothing are wet, as if she has just returned from a swim. Her smile seems friendly enough.</em><br>When a woman drowns, her dripping body may rise again as a rusalka. Some claim the drowning must be a suicide. Others say that the water itself must be tainted with murder or some great evil spirit.<br><strong>Near Water.</strong> Rusalkas dwell in the water where they died, emerging only at night. Some climb a nearby tree, dangle their feet in the water, and sing alluring songs. Others sit on the bank, combing their wet tresses and awaiting prey. They must, however, remain in or near the water where they died, as part of their curse. However, during a full moon, the rusalki can leave the water to dance along the shore or the riverbank, singing all night long and inviting young men to join them.<br><strong>Songs and Poetry.</strong> Rusalkas mesmerize and seduce passersby with song and dance and poetry. Young men are their usual victims, but they also prey on curious children, lonely older men, and other heartbroken women. When a potential victim comes near enough, the rusalki entangles the person with her hair and drags him or her beneath the water to drown.<br><strong>Lover’s Walks.</strong> A rusalka cannot pass for human on any but the darkest night, but she might claim to be a lonely tree spirit or a benevolent nymph willing to grant a wish in exchange for a kiss. She may part the water of a lake and coax her victim toward the center with the promise of a kiss—delivered as her hair entraps the victim and the water rushes around him. Alternatively, she may use water walk so she and the victim can stroll across the surface of the water, reward him with a long kiss (to prevent him from catching a deep breath), then end the spell over deep water and drag him to the bottom.<br><strong>Undead Nature.</strong> A rusalka doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.<br><em><strong>Flood.</strong></em> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.<br>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.<br>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.<br><em><strong>Part Water.</strong></em> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.<br><em><strong>Redirect flow.</strong></em> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.<br><em><strong>Whirlpool.</strong></em> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.<br>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.<br>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.",
