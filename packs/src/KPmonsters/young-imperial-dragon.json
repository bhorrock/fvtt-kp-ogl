        "value": "<p><em>The long, serpentine dragon is wingless and possesses shimmering, opalescent scales. Its appearance is at once both serene and majestic.</em><br><strong>Dragons of the Spirit World.</strong> Imperial dragons are tied to the world of celestials, fiends, and spirits. They freely parley with such creatures for knowledge about the outer planes or the fundamental mysteries of the universe. Some of the most powerful imperial dragons even become the servants of the gods in exchange for wisdom, acting as intermediaries between the divine and mortal realms.<br><strong>Colorful and Magical.</strong> Imperial dragons are capable of changing their colors and forms. They are typically a rich, golden-yellow, but azure-, jade-, and vermillion-colored dragons are not unheard of, and even white and black imperial dragons have been reported. A magical organ in their skulls gives them the ability to fly without the aid of wings, and they are often hunted for this organ, which is rumored to grant eternal life if consumed.<br><strong>Masters of Wind and Rain.</strong> Imperial dragons are creatures of wind and water, and the eldest of their kind exhibit mastery of these elements. They love the seas where they make their homes and sometimes act as guardians for sacred sites or temples near or beneath the waves. This often puts them in conflict with militant aquatic races like the @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.lyNBFmJdbh4NLRzz]{sahuagin} and evil water-dwelling monsters like @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.kVg37NlPcACAzjCT]{krakens} and @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPancientseadragon]{sea dragons}.<br><h2>An Imperial Dragon’s Lair</h2><br>Imperial dragons live deep below the water, typically in large rivers, lakes, and seas. While some live in simple caves, most construct great palaces of coral and kelp. These magnificent structures contain areas where air-breathing creatures can live without discomfort, and the palaces of the oldest dragons are filled with menageries, bathhouses, and even entire libraries of rare and esoteric texts.<br><h3>Lair Actions</h3><br>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<ul><li>The dragon causes a bolt of lightning to strike a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) lightning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw.</li><li>The dragon calls coral to surround one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. While restrained in this way, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature, including the target, can take its action to free the target by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The coral can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 15; vulnerability to bludgeoning damage; immunity to poison and psychic damage). The coral crumbles when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li><li>A whirl of water or wind appears on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it and disappears just as quickly. Each creature within 30 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward that point and knocked prone.</li><br><h3>Regional Effects</h3><br>The region containing a legendary imperial dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:<li>The dragon’s mood affects the weather and water within 6 miles of its lair. When the dragon is calm or sleeping, the sky is clear and the water still. When the dragon is angry or troubled, the sky is filled with storm clouds and the water becomes choppy.</li><li>Fish and other marine life become more numerous within 3 miles of the dragon’s lair.</li><li>Pearls within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair are imbued with healing magic. If a harvested pearl is crushed into a powder and then consumed, it provides the benefits of a potion of healing. If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</li><br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}",

As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.<br><em><strong>Flood.</strong></em> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.<br>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.<br>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.<br><em><strong>Part Water.</strong></em> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.<br><em><strong>Redirect flow.</strong></em> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.<br><em><strong>Whirlpool.</strong></em> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.<br>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.<br>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.",
