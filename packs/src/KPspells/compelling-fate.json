If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you can predict that creature's actions. This has the following effects:<ul><li>You have advantage on attack rolls against the target.</li><li>For every 5 feet the target moves, you can move 5 feet (up to your normal movement) on the target's turn when it has completed its movement. This is deducted from your next turn's movement.</li><li>As a reaction at the start of the target's turn, you can warn yourself and allies that can hear you of the target's offensive intentions; any creature targeted by the target's next attack gains a +2 bonus to AC or to its saving throw against that attack.</li><br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd.",
