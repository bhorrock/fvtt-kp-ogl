On a failed save, the target takes the same amount and type of damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. The attacker can use the weapon on itself and thus cause the target to take identical damage. A self-inflicted wound hits automatically, but damage is still rolled randomly.<br>Once the connection is established, it lasts for the duration of the spell regardless of range, so long as all three elements remain on the same plane. The spell ends immediately if the attacker receives any healing.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> The target has disadvantage on its Charisma saving throws if <em>spiteful weapon</em> is cast using a spell slot of 5th level or higher.",
