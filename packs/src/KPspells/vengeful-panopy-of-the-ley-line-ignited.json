      "value": "<p><em><strong>Deep Magic: </strong>ley line</em><br>While bound to a ley line, you draw directly from its power, becoming cloaked in a magical heliotropic fire that sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. Additionally, each round, including the round it is cast, you may make a ranged spell attack as an action. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 force damage. Every 3 minutes the effect is active, your bond with the ley line is reduced by one step; a bond to a Titanic ley line becomes effectively a Strong, then a Weak, and after 10 minutes, the bond is broken. The strength of the bond is only restored after a long rest; if the bond was broken, it can only be restored at the next weakest level for a week. A bond broken from a Weak ley line cannot be restored for two weeks. Some believe this spell damages ley lines, and there is some evidence to support this claim.<br>Additionally, whenever a creature within 5 feet hits you with a melee attack, the cloak erupts with a heliotropic flare. The attacker takes 3d6 force damage.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When casting this spell using a spell slot of 6th level, the damage from all effects of the spell increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.",
