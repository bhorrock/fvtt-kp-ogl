The target can't cast spells or attack, and attack rolls against it are made with disadvantage. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while next to a wall or similar flat surface. The target can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If it occupies the same space as an object or a creature when the spell ends, the creature is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it was moved.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.",
