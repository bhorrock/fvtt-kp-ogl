      "value": "<p><em><strong>Deep Magic: </strong>clockwork ritual</em><br>You call upon the dark blessings of the furnace god Molech. In an hour-long ritual begun at midnight, you dedicate a living being to Molech by branding the deity's symbol onto the victim's forehead. If the ritual is completed and the victim fails to make a successful Wisdom saving throw (or the victim chooses not to make one), the being is transformed into an avatar of Molech under your control.<br>The avatar is 8 feet tall and appears to be made of black iron wreathed in flames. Its eyes, mouth, and a portion of its torso are cut away to show the churning fire inside that crackles with wailing voices. The avatar has all the statistics and abilities of an @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.sApYLZj9PTZ40wJr]{earth elemental}, with the following differences:<ul><li>Alignment is Neutral Evil;</li><li>Speed is 50 feet and it cannot burrow or use earth glide;</li><li>it gains the fire form ability of a fire elemental, but it cannot squeeze through small spaces;</li><li>its Slam does an additional 1d10 fire damage.</li><br>This transformation lasts for 24 hours. At the end of that time, the subject returns to its normal state and takes 77 (14d10) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw.",
