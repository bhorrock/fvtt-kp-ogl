Choose an origin point within the spell's range that you can see. Starting from that point, the crystals burst out of the ground along a 30-foot line. All creatures in that line and up to 100 feet above it take 2d8 thunder damage plus 2d8 piercing damage; a successful Dexterity saving throw negates the piercing damage.<br>A creature that fails the saving throw is impaled by a chunk of crystal that halves the creature's speed, prevents it from flying, and causes it to fall to the ground if it was flying. To remove a crystal, the creature or an ally within 5 feet of it must use an action and make a successful DC 13 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the impaled creature takes 1d8 piercing damage and its speed and flying ability are restored to normal.",
