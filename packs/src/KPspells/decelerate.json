      "value": "<p><em><strong>Deep Magic: </strong>temporal</em><br>You slow the flow of time around a creature within range that you can see. The creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5-foot increment). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Until the spell ends, on a failed save the target's speed is halved again at the start of each of your turns. For example, if a creature with a speed of 30 feet fails its initial saving throw, its speed drops to 15 feet. At the start of your next turn, the creature's speed drops to 10 feet on a failed save, then to 5 feet on the following round on another failed save. <em>Decelerate</em> can't reduce a creature's speed to less than 5 feet.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect an additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.",
