      "value": "<p><em><strong>Deep Magic: </strong>Rothenian</em><br>A powerful wind swirls from your outstretched hand toward a point you choose within range, where it explodes with a low roar into vortex of air. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, is pulled to the center of the cylinder, and thrown 50 feet upward into the air. If a creature hits a solid obstruction, such as a stone ceiling, when it's thrown upward, it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen (50 feet - the distance it's traveled upward). For example, if a creature hits the ceiling after rising only 10 feet, it takes bludgeoning damage as if it had fallen (50 feet - 10 feet =) 40 feet, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the distance affected creatures are thrown into the air by 10 feet for each slot above 3rd.",
