If you are in a physical maze or any similar structure with multiple paths and dead ends, this spell guides you to the nearest exit, although not necessarily along the fastest or shortest route.<br>In addition, while the spell is guiding you out of such a structure, you have advantage on ability checks to avoid being surprised and on initiative rolls.<br>You gain a perfect memory of all portions of the structure you move through during the spell's duration. If you revisit such a portion, you recognize that you've been there before and automatically notice any changes to the environment.<br>Also, while under the effect of this spell, you can exit any <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.clwv2PWOcT822hlr]{maze}</em> spell (and its lesser and greater varieties) as an action without needing to make an Intelligence check.",
