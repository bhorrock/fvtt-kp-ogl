      "value": "<p>When you cast <em>doom of disenchantment</em>, your armor and shield glow with light. When a creature hits you with an attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a <em>+1 weapon</em> would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you.<br>The spell also suppresses other magical properties of the attack. A <em>sword of wounding</em>, for example, can't cause ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost to the weapon's damage normally. If the attack was a spell, it's affected as if you had cast <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}</em>, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of instantaneous, however, are unaffected.",
