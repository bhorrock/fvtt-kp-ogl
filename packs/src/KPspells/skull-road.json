The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5-20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.<br>If your casting is at 5th level, this opens a pathway to the River of Tears, to the Vitreous Mire, or to the Plains of Bone-travel to a settlement can take up to 7 days (1d6+1). If cast at 7th level, the <em>skull road</em> spell opens a portal to a small settlement of gnolls, ghouls, or shadows on the plane near the Eternal Palace of Mot or a similar settlement.<br>Undead casters can use this spell in the reverse direction, opening a portal from Evermaw to the mortal world, though with similar restrictions. At 5th level, the portal opens in a dark forest, cavern, or ruins far from habitation. At 7th level, the skull road leads directly to a tomb, cemetery, or mass grave near a humanoid settlement of some kind.",
