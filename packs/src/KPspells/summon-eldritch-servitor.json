Choose one of the following options for what appears:<ul><li>Two @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPghastofleng]{ghasts of Leng}</li><li>One @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPshantak]{shantak}</li><br>When the summoned creatures appear, you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creatures are friendly to you and your allies. On a failure, the creatures are friendly to no one and attack the nearest creatures, pursuing and fighting for as long as possible.<br>Roll initiative for the summoned creatures, which take their own turns as a group. If friendly to you, they obey your verbal commands (no action required by you to issue a command), or they attack the nearest living creature if they are not commanded otherwise.<br>Each round when you maintain concentration on the spell, you must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn or take 1d4 psychic damage. If the total of this damage exceeds your Wisdom score, you gain 1 point of Void taint and you are afflicted with a form of short-term madness. The same penalty applies when the damage exceeds twice your Wisdom score, three times your Wisdom score, and so forth, if you maintain concentration for that long.<br>A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. If you stop concentrating on the spell before 1 hour has elapsed, the creatures become uncontrolled and hostile until they disappear 1d6 rounds later or until they are killed.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a 7th- or 8th-level spell slot, you can summon four @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPghastofleng]{ghasts of Leng} or a @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPhoundoftindalos]{hound of Tindalos}. When you cast it with a 9th-level spell slot, you can summon five @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPghastofleng]{ghasts of Leng} or a @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPnightgaunt]{nightgaunt}.",
