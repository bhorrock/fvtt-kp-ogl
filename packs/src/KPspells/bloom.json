Any seeds planted in the area grow at twice the natural rate. Food harvested regrows within a week. After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.<br>Choose one of the following effects, which appears and grows immediately:<ul><li>A field planted with vegetables of your choice, ready for harvest.</li><li>A thick forest of stout trees and ample undergrowth.</li><li>A grassland with wildflowers and fodder for grazing.</li><li>An orchard of fruit trees of your choice, growing in orderly rows and ready for harvest.</li><br>Living creatures that take a short rest within the area of a bloom spell receive the maximum hit points for Hit Dice expended. <em>Bloom</em> counters the effects of a <em>@Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.KPdesolation]{desolation}</em> spell.<br><em><strong>Ritual Focus.</strong></em> If you expend your ritual focus, the duration becomes permanent.",
