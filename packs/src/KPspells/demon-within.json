You choose the demon's type from among those of challenge rating of 4 or lower. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the gateway fails to open, and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 force damage from the demon's attempt to claw its way through the gate. For the spell's duration, you can use a bonus action to further agitate the demon, dealing an additional 2d6 force damage to the target each time.<br>If the target drops to 0 hit points while affected by this spell, the demon tears through the body and appears in the same space as its now @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.tUYvSkhggFcMpVw5]{incapacitated} or dead victim. You do not control this demon; it is free to either attack or leave the area as it chooses. The demon disappears after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points.",
