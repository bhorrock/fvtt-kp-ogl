      "value": "<p><em><strong>Deep Magic: </strong>illumination</em><br>This spell increases gravity tenfold in a 50-foot radius centered on you. Each creature in the area other than you drops whatever it's holding, falls @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.ZkXz0qdkNBkKE6tN]{prone}, becomes incapacitated, and can't move. If a solid object (such as the ground) is encountered when a flying or levitating creature falls, the creature takes three times the normal falling damage. Any creature except you that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone and become incapacitated and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn prone and incapacitated makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage, it's no longer incapacitated, and it can move at half speed.<br>All ranged weapon attacks inside the area have a normal range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet. The same applies to spells that create missiles that have mass, such as <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.FjYE214HTERCRZNm]{flaming sphere}</em>. A creature under the influence of a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}</em> spell or comparable magic has advantage on the Strength saving throws required by this spell, and its speed isn't reduced once it recovers from being incapacitated.",
