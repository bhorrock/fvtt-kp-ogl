Each creature in the line takes 14d6 acid damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is killed, and its body is liquefied. In addition, each creature other than you that's in the line or within 5 feet of it is @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.prcOUhkWEVppFVbg]{poisoned} for 1 minute by toxic fumes. Creatures that don't breathe or that are immune to acid damage aren't poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.",
