When you are the target of a ranged weapon attack or a ranged spell attack and before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to shout \"Pull!\" When you do, one clay pigeon maneuvers to block the incoming attack. If the attack roll is less than 10 + your proficiency bonus, the attack misses. Otherwise, make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier and compare it to the attack roll. If your roll is higher, the attack is intercepted and has no effect. Regardless of whether the attack is intercepted, one clay pigeon is expended. The spell ends when the last clay pigeon is used.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, add 1 to your to your roll for each slot level above 3rd when determining if an attack misses or when making a check to intercept the attack.",
