      "value": "<p>After you cast <em>create thunderstaff</em> on a normal quarterstaff, the staff must then be mounted in a noisy location, such as a busy marketplace, and left there for 60 days. During that time, the staff gradually absorbs ambient sound.<br>After 60 days, the staff is fully charged and can't absorb any more sound. At that point, it becomes a <em>thunderstaff</em>, a +1 quarterstaff that has 10 charges. When you hit on a melee attack with the staff and expend 1 charge, the target takes an extra 1d8 thunder damage. You can cast a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WTbOQBsarsL1LuXJ]{thunderwave}</em> spell from the staff as a bonus action by expending 2 charges. The staff cannot be recharged.<br>If the final charge is not expended within 60 days, the staff becomes nonmagical again.",
