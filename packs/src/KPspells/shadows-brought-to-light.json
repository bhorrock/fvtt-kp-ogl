When casting the spell, you choose whether everyone present will hear the secret, in which case the shadow speaks loudly in a twisted version of the target's voice, or if the secret is whispered only to you. The shadow speaks in the target's native language.<br>If the target does not have a scandalous secret or does not have a spoken language, the spell fails as if the creature's saving throw had succeeded.<br>If the secret was spoken aloud, the target takes a -2 penalty to Charisma checks involving anyone who was present when it was revealed. This penalty lasts until you finish a long rest.<br><em><strong>Ritual Focus.</strong></em> If you expend your ritual focus, the target has disadvantage on Charisma checks instead of taking the -2 penalty.",
