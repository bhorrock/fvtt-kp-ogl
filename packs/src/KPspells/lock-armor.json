      "value": "<p>You target a piece of metal equipment or a metal construct. If the target is a creature wearing metal armor or is a construct, it makes a Wisdom saving throw to negate the effect. On a failed save, the spell causes metal to cling to metal, making it impossible to move pieces against each other. This effectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected. Metal constructs are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.BJaVW22yVYe7dtzq]{paralyzed}. An affected creature or construct can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A grease spell dispels lock armor on everything in its area.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.",
