      "value": "<p><em><strong>Deep Magic: </strong>ritual only</em><br>You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates.<br>The vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. It has AC 8, hit points equal to 5 Ã— your spellcasting level, and a damage threshold of 5.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the vine can support an additional 30 pounds, and its damage threshold increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.<br><em><strong>Ritual Focus.</strong></em> If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is permanent until destroyed or dispelled.",
