      "value": "<p>This spell creates a wall of swinging axes from the pile of miniature axes you provide when casting the spell. The wall fills a rectangle 10 feet wide, 10 feet high, and 20 feet long. The wall has a base speed of 50 feet, but it can't take the Dash action. It can make up to four attacks per round on your turn, using your spell attack modifier to hit and with a reach of 10 feet. You direct the wall's movement and attacks as a bonus action. If you choose not to direct it, the wall continues trying to execute the last command you gave it. The wall can't use reactions. Each successful attack deals 4d6 slashing damage, and the damage is considered magical.<br>The wall has AC 12 and 200 hit points, and is immune to necrotic, poison, psychic, and piercing damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell's duration ends, the wall disappears and the miniature axes fall to the ground in a tidy heap.",
