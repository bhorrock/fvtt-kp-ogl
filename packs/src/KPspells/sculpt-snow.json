      "value": "<p><em><strong>Deep Magic: </strong>winter</em><br>When you <em>cast sculpt</em> snow in an area filled with snow, you can create one Large object, two Medium objects, or four smaller objects from snow. With a casting time of 1 action, your sculptings bear only a crude resemblance to generic creatures or objects. If you increase the casting time to 1 minute, your creations take on a more realistic appearance and can even vaguely resemble specific creatures; the resemblance isn't strong enough to fool anyone, but the creature can be recognized. The sculptures are as durable as a typical snowman.<br>Sculptures created by this spell can be animated with <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ATo0Eb63TDtnu6iA]{animate objects}</em> or comparable magic. Animated sculptures gain the AC, hit points, and other attributes provided by that spell. When they attack, they deal normal damage plus a similar amount of cold damage; an animated Medium sculpture, for example, deals 2d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage plus 2d6 + 1 cold damage.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can sculpt one additional Large object for each slot level above 2nd. Two Large objects can be replaced with one Huge object.",
