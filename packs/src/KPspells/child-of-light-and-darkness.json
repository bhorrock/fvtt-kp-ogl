On a roll of 11-20, you take the form of a humanoid made of bone-chilling darkness. In both forms, you have immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and a creature that attacks you has disadvantage on the attack roll. You gain additional benefits while in each form:<br><em><strong>Light Form.</strong></em> You shed bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet, you are immune to fire damage, and you have resistance to radiant damage. Once per turn, as a bonus action, you can teleport to a space you can see within the light you shed.<br><em><strong>Darkness Form.</strong></em> You are immune to cold damage, and you have resistance to necrotic damage. Once per turn, as a bonus action, you can target up to three Large or smaller creatures within 30 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled or pushed (your choice) up to 20 feet straight toward or away from you.",
