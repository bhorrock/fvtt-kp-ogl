In addition, if your ally must make a saving throw against an enemy's spell that deals damage, the ally takes half as much damage on a failed saving throw and no damage on a successful save. Ally aegis offers no protection, however, against psychic damage from any source.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can target one additional ally for each slot level above 6th.",
