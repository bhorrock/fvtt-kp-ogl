This spell has no effect on any creatures except undead, and it cannot restore a lich whose phylactery has been destroyed, a vampire destroyed by sunlight, any undead whose remains are destroyed by fire, acid, or holy water, or any remains affected by a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.8dzaICjGy6mTUaUr]{bless}</em> or <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.n4JDcFKe5ikzYmAc]{gentle repose}</em> spell.<br>This spell doesn't remove magical effects. If they aren't removed prior to casting, they return when the undead creature comes back to life.<br>This spell closes all mortal wounds but doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature doesn't have body parts or organs necessary for survival, the spell fails.<br>Sudden reassembly is an ordeal involving enormous expenditure of necrotic energy; ley line casters within 5 miles are aware that some great shift in life forces has occurred and a sense of its direction. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attacks, saves, and ability checks. Every time it finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.",
