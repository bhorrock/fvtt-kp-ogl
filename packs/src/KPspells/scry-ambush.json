Those allies are also not surprised by the attack and can act normally in the first round of combat.<br>If you would be surprised, you must make a check using your spellcasting ability at the moment your reaction would be triggered. The check DC is equal to the current initiative count. On a failed check, you are surprised and can't use your reaction to cast this spell until after your next turn. On a successful check, you can use your reaction to cast this spell immediately.",
