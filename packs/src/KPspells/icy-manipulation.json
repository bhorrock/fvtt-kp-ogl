A petrified creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if it makes two successful saves. If a petrified creature gets two failures on the saving throw (not counting the original failure that caused the petrification), the petrification becomes permenant.<br>The petrification also becomes permanent if you maintain concentration on this spell for a full minute. A permanently petrified/frozen creature can be restored to normal with <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}</em> or comparable magic, or by casting this spell on the creature again and maintaining concentration for a full minute.<br>If the frozen creature is damaged or broken before it recovers from being petrified, the injury carries over to its normal state.",
