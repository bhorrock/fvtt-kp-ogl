      "value": "Wherever people thrive in a civilization, there are always some who exist on the fringes of society; a lower caste trapped by poverty. These poor souls fade into the background even as they desperately seek compassion from the more prosperous citizens around them. You spent a significant portion of your life living in the lowest station of your home city, dependent on the charity of others to survive. Youâ€™ve learned to fade into the background, and you know how to use the proper expression and tone of voice to leverage a mark into letting go of a few coins. Use the following variant skill proficiencies and features in place of those normally granted by the urchin background.",
